The scene is set in Venice, where Antonio is on trial in the courtroom. The Duke of Venice expresses his sympathy towards Antonio and condemns Shylock as an inhumane monster who cannot feel pity or mercy. Antonio, however, maintains his composure and accepts his fate, saying that he will face Shylock's anger with a calm spirit.

Shylock enters the courtroom, and the Duke addresses him, stating that he believes Shylock only intends to scare Antonio and not actually go through with the punishment. Shylock reiterates his intentions, claiming that if the court denies him his right, it would be a violation of the city's laws and freedoms. He offers no justification for his actions other than the fact that he hates Antonio.

Bassanio arrives from Belmont and tries to reason with Shylock, but Antonio tells him not to bother. Antonio argues that some men are naturally inclined towards evil and violence, just like how wolves are naturally predatory. Bassanio offers Shylock double the original loan, but Shylock refuses, stating that he will not relinquish his bond for any amount of money.

The Duke questions Shylock's lack of mercy and asks how he expects to receive mercy when he offers none himself. Shylock replies that he has done nothing wrong and therefore does not need mercy. He compares his claim to Antonio's flesh to Christians who refuse to set their slaves free.

The Duke announces that he has contacted Doctor Bellario to make a judgment in the matter. While waiting for Bellario's response, Nerissa enters the courtroom disguised as a clerk and presents the Duke with a letter from Bellario. The letter states that Bellario is ill and unable to attend court but has sent a learned young lawyer named Balthasar to take his place.

Portia enters the courtroom disguised as Balthasar, and the Duke asks if she is familiar with the case. Portia responds that she is and calls Antonio and Shylock before her. She asks if Antonio admits to owing Shylock money, to which he responds affirmatively. Portia then appeals to Shylock's sense of mercy, stating that mercy is a blessing for both the giver and receiver and that it is a godly trait. Shylock, however, remains resolute in his demand for justice and revenge.

Bassanio offers to pay Shylock twice the amount owed, and even ten times if necessary, to release Antonio from the bond. Portia, however, insists that the law must be upheld, and the ruling of Venice must stand. Shylock remains unyielding, and Portia orders him to prepare to collect his pound of flesh. She reminds him that the bond stipulates only a pound of flesh and no blood.

As Shylock is about to cut into Antonio, Portia reminds him that he must not spill any blood. She urges him to continue collecting his pound of flesh, but warns him that if he spills any blood, he will be guilty of conspiring against the life of a Venetian citizen and forfeit all his wealth. The scene ends with Antonio bidding farewell to Bassanio, and both men expressing their willingness to sacrifice everything to prove their love for each other.
